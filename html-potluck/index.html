            <h3>Ingredients</h3>     
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Step 1</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; 
                gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine. 
                Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Step 2</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. 
            Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 
            1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so 
            that the batter coats the surface evenly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Step 3</b>
        </p>
        <p>
                Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the 
                bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a 
                spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; 
                flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, 
                about 1 minute more. Serve hot.

        <p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>     
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon grapeseed oil</li>
            <li>Four 8-ounce skinless, boneless chicken breasts, 
                pounded to an even thickness
            </li>
            <li>Salt/Pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups panko crumbs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 medium shallot, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 pounds cremini or white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced tarragon leaves</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Step 1</b>
        </p>
        <p>In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil until shimmering. 
            Season the chicken with salt and pepper, add to the skillet and 
            cook over moderately high heat, turning once, until browned, about 
            3 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a plate.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Step 2</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Add the butter, shallot, salt and mushrooms to the skillet and 
            cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms begin to brown, 
            about 12 minutes. Add the flour and cook until it smells 
            lightly toasty, about 1 minute.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Step 3</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Add the wine, broth and reserved chicken and bring to a simmer. 
            Cover and cook over moderate heat until the chicken is cooked 
            through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a serving dish.
        </p>
        <b>Step 4</b>
        </p>
        <p>Increase the heat to moderately high and simmer the sauce, 
            uncovered, until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Remove the 
            skillet from the heat and stir in the minced tarragon and heavy 
            cream. Spoon the sauce and mushrooms over the chicken and 
            serve immediately.
