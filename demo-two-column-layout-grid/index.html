                    Balenciaga SA (/bəˌlɛnsiˈɑːɡə/ bə-LEN-see-AH-gə[1]) is 
                    luxury fashion house founded in 1919 by the Spanish 
                    couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga in San Sebastian, Spain. 
                    Balenciaga produces ready-to-wear footwear, handbags, 
                    and accessories, and licenses its name and branding to 
                    Coty for fragrances.[2] It is currently owned by the 
                    French corporation Kering.

                    Cristóbal Balenciaga opened his first boutique in 
                    San Sebastián, Spain, in 1919, and expanded to 
                    include branches in Madrid and Barcelona.[3] 
                    The Spanish royal family and aristocracy wore 
                    his designs. When the Spanish Civil War forced 
                    him to close his stores, he moved to Paris.[3][4]

                    Cristóbal Balenciaga opened his first boutique in San 
                    Sebastián, Spain, in 1919, and expanded to include 
                    branches in Madrid and Barcelona.[3] The Spanish royal 
                    family and aristocracy wore his designs. When the Spanish 
                    Civil War forced him to close his stores, he moved to 
                    Paris.[3][4]
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Balenciaga opened his Paris couture house on Avenue 
                    George V in August 1937, where his first fashion 
                    show featured designs heavily influenced by the 
                    Spanish Renaissance.[3] His success was nearly 
                    immediate. In two years, the press lauded him as a 
                    revolutionary, and his designs were highly sought-after.
                    [3] Carmel Snow, the editor of Harper's Bazaar, was an 
                    early champion of his designs.[5]

                    Customers risked their safety traveling to Europe during 
                    World War II to see Balenciaga's clothing.<sup>[3]</sup> 
                    During this period, he was noted for his "square coat", 
                    with sleeves cut in a single piece with the yoke, 
                    and for his designs with black (or black and brown) 
                    lace over bright pink fabric.<sup>[3]</sup> Historians 
                    believe that Balenciaga's continued activity during the 
                    Nazi occupation of Paris was made possible by his 
                    connections with Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco 
                    who was Adolf Hitler's close ally.<sup>[6]</sup> The 
                    relation to Franco was so close that Balenciaga designed 
                    clothing for the Franco family.<sup>[7]</sup>The company 
                    was one of only 60 allowed to operate during the 
                    occupation, and the ongoing supply of raw materials from 
                    Spain, which were in short supply in Paris due to the war, 
                    gave Balenciaga a competitive advantage. However, he 
                    testified that he refused Hitler's request to transfer 
                    his company's activities to Berlin.<sup>[8][9]</sup>
