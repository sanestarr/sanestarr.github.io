        <b>Crown shyness</b> <i>(also canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup> canopy 
        shyness,<sup>[2]</sup>or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup>)</i> is a
        feature observed in some tree species,in which the crowns of fully 
        stocked trees do not touch each other, instead forming a canopy with
        channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> This is most prevalent among 
        trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different 
        species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as to why crown 
        shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might
        inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
            <sup>[6]</sup>It has been discussed in scientific literature 
            since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup>The variety of hypotheses and 
            experimental results might suggest that there are multiple 
            mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent 
            evolution.

        <p>Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy 
            branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. 
            Trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide 
            with each other during winds. The abrasions and collisions 
            induce a crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral
            branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until
            disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup> If the crowns are
            artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they
            gradually fill the canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> This explains instances of
            crown shyness between branches of the same organism.
            Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly
            seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy
            forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession
            forests where branches are flexible and limited in
            lateral movement.<sup>[6][12]</sup> According to this theory,
            variable flexibility in lateral branches greatly
            influences the degree of crown shyness.
