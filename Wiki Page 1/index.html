        <p>Graphic design is a profession,<sup>[2]</sup> academic 
            discipline<sup>[3][4][5]</sup> and applied art whose activity 
            consists in projecting visual communications intended to 
            transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific 
            objectives.<sup>[6]</sup> Graphic design is an interdisciplinary 
            branch of design<sup>[1]</sup> and of the fine arts. 
            Its practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral thinking 
            using manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text 
            and graphics to communicate visually.

            The role of the graphic designer in the 
            communication process is that of encoder or 
            interpreter of the message. They work on the 
            interpretation, ordering, and presentation of 
            visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses 
            the aesthetics of typography and the compositional
            arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey
            ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language 
            alone expresses. The design work can be based on a 
            customer's demand, a demand that ends up being 
            established linguistically, either orally or in writing, 
            that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic 
            message into a graphic manifestation.<sup>[7]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, 
            different areas of knowledge focused on any visual 
            communication system. For example, it can be applied 
            in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied 
            in the aviation world<sup>[8]</sup> or space 
            exploration.<sup>[9][10]</sup>In this sense, in some countries 
            graphic design is related as only associated with the production 
            of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual 
            communication is a small part of a huge range of types and 
            classes where it can be applied.

            William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the 
            term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,[14] although it appears 
            in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, 
            a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an 
            article about technical education for printers:[15]An 
            Enterprising Trades Union.The admittedly high standard 
            of intelligence which prevails among printers is an 
            assurance that with the elemental principles of design 
            at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge 
            and develop into specialists in graphic design and 
            decorating.A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of 
            the California School of Arts & Crafts advertised a course 
            titled Graphic Design and Lettering, which replaced one called 
            Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes were taught 
            by Frederick Meyer.[16]

            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent 
            explosion of visual communication in the 20th and 21st 
            centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, 
            graphic design and fine art has disappeared. They share 
            many elements, theories, principles, practices, languages 
            and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, 
            the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. 
            In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to information, 
            form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that 
            document the human experience."<sup>[17]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively 
            recent concerning its preparation, activity, and objectives. 
            Although there is no consensus on an exact date when graphic 
            design emerged, some date it back to the Interwar period. 
            Others understand that it began to be identified as such 
            by the late 19th century.<sup>[11]</sup>It can be argued that 
            graphic communications with specific purposes have their origins in 
            Paleolithic cave paintings and the birth of written language 
            in the third millennium BCE. However, the differences in 
            working methods, auxiliary sciences, and required training 
            are such that it is not possible to clearly identify the 
            current graphic designer with prehistoric man, the 
            15th-century xylographer, or the lithographer of 1890.

            The diversity of opinions stems from some considering 
            any graphic manifestation as a product of graphic design, 
            while others only recognize those that arise as a result of 
            the application of an industrial production model—visual 
            manifestations that have been "projected" to address various 
            needs: productive, symbolic, ergonomic, contextual, among others.

            Graphic design can have many applications, from road 
            signs to technical schematics and reference manuals. 
            It is often used in branding products and elements of 
            company identity such as logos, colors, packaging, 
            labelling and text.

            From scientific journals to news 
            reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often 
            improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual 
            information – known as information design. With the advent 
            of the web, information designers with experience in 
            interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate 
            the background to news stories. Information design can 
            include Data and information visualization, which involves 
            using programs to interpret and form data into a visually 
            compelling presentation, and can be tied in with 
            information graphics.

            A graphic design project may involve the creative presentation 
            of existing text, ornament, and images.

            The "process school" is concerned with communication; it 
            highlights the channels and media through which messages 
            are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode 
            and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a 
            message as a construction of signs which through interaction 
            with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.
